- 👋 Hi, my names Samuel Williams - @swilliamssw

- 👀 I’m interested in building a range of software’s and having fun while doing it. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build software's related to cyber security, but I am also trying to acquire skills to versatile my coding experience.

- 💞️ I’m looking to break into the IT industry with my current coding skills and add to the fundamentals I currently hold. 
     I have built a couple small programs at the moment, but I’m interested in growing these and adding more complicated and sophisticated programs at a later date which can be identified at a professional level.
